# Slides

This directory contains presentation slides created with [Slidev](https://sli.dev/).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 18 or higher recommended).

## ðŸ“Š Running the Slides

### Development Mode

To run a slide deck in development mode with hot-reload, use the npm scripts:

**Dependency Injection slides:**
```bash
npm run dev:di
```

**JavaScript vs TypeScript comparison:**
```bash
npm run dev:js-ts
```

The slides will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3030` by default.

### Presenter Mode

To open presenter mode while viewing the slides, press `O` (or click the presenter icon). This will open a separate window with:
- Current and next slide preview

### Building for Production

To build static HTML for deployment:

**Build a specific deck:**
```bash
npm run build:di        # Builds dependency injection slides
npm run build:js-ts     # Builds JavaScript vs TypeScript slides
```

**Build all decks:**
```bash
npm run build:all
```

The output will be in the `dist` folder (organized by topic).

### Exporting to PDF

To export slides as PDF:

**Export a specific deck:**
```bash
npm run export:di-pdf      # Exports dependency injection slides to PDF
npm run export:js-ts-pdf   # Exports JavaScript vs TypeScript slides to PDF
```

**Export all decks:**
