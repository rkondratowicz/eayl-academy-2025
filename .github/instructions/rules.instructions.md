After completing a task, make sure that the README.md file is updated - add any new slides, cheatsheets, or links to the relevant sections.
Keep the the document structure as is, just add new entries as bullet points under the appropriate sections.

## Code Formatting

After completing any work, always run the Biome formatter to ensure consistent code formatting across the project:

```bash
npm run format:biome
```

This should be done as the final step before considering the task complete.
