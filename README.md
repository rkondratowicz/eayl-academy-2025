## Quick Start

### Running Presentations Interactively

Use the interactive presentation launcher (requires [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)):

```bash
./slides.sh
```

The script will:

- Show you a list of all available presentations
- Let you select one interactively
- Run the selected presentation with Slidev

**Installing gum:**

- macOS/Linux: `brew install gum`
- Other platforms: https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#installation

## Development

### Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting and linting. Biome is a fast, modern toolchain that combines formatting, linting, and import sorting in one tool.

**Available commands:**

```bash
# Format all files
npm run format

# Format all files (alias)
npm run format:biome

# Lint all files and auto-fix issues
npm run lint

# Check formatting, linting, and imports (recommended)
npm run check
```

**Configuration:**

Biome is configured via `biome.json` with the following settings:

- **Formatter:** Tab indentation, 120 character line width
- **Linter:** Enabled with recommended rules
- **VCS:** Git integration enabled with ignore file support
- **JavaScript:** Double quotes for strings
- **Assist:** Auto-organize imports on save

**Note:** Always run `npm run format:biome` after completing any work to ensure consistent code formatting across the project.
